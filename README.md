# telephone4telephones

This is a Twilio application that simulates the game of telephone, using actual
telephones.

Text the number associated with the application to add your phone to the
telephone chain. When the "game master" texts "go" to the app, the game begins.
The first person records a message to begin the chain. Each other person in the
chain hears a recording of the previous person until it gets to the last person.
Try to see how well you can relay the message!

PROGRAM NOTES

This is just a demo. Notably, the "http://f81a966a.ngrok.io/next-call" is not a
permanent URL. This is the temporary URL generated by ngrok and will not
continue to work, even just by closing and reopening the ngrok tunnel.
